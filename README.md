# TypeScript Discord Bot

This project was me trying to get some exposure to TypeScript and Yarn. 

 [I followed this tutorial](https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-build-discord-bot-typescript#google_vignette) and used their design pattern to make my own personal command that would post a gif in a discord channel.

I ended up spending a lot more time on this project because it would expose me to some techs that I wanted to play with. https://github.com/OpenSeth/spring-native-discord-bot
