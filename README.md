# TypeScript Discord Bot

This project was me trying to get some exposure to TypeScript and Yarn. 

 [I followed this tutorial](https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-build-discord-bot-typescript#google_vignette) and used their design pattern to make my own personal command that would post a gif in a discord channel.

I have the desire to make more powerful commands that can parse posts and give reports or statistics on what people are talking about. IE scrape posts for music recommendations and build playlists. I will likely explore that idea in java or python.
